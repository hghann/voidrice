## About this repo

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for
convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs.
Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their
own dotfiles.

- Very useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
	- vim (text editor)
	- zsh (shell)
	- lf (file manager)
	- zathura (pdf viewer)
	- mpd/ncmpcpp (music)
	- sxiv (image/gif viewer)
	- mpv (video player)
	- newsboat (rss reader)
	- other stuff like xdg default programs, inputrc and more, etc.
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	- Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.zshenv` to move configs into `~/.config/`

## Highlights

- Minimal efforts to install everything, using a [Makefile](./Makefile)
- Fast and colored prompt
- Well-organized and easy to customize


## Packages Overview

These dotfiles are intended to go with numerous suckless programs I use:

- [dwm](https://github.com/hghann/dwm) (window manager)
- [dwmblocks](https://github.com/hghann/dwmblocks) (statusbar)
- [st](https://github.com/hghann/st) (terminal emulator)

## Install these dotfiles and all dependencies

This repo is managed by a makefile. Run `make` with no arguments to list
all commands that could be executed.

Use Makefile to deploy everything:

```
make init
```

On a sparkling fresh installation of Void linux:

```bash
sudo xbps-install -Syu git make curl
```

Ths command installs `git`, `make`, and `curl` (not available on stock
void linux). Now there are two options:

1. Install this repo with `curl` available:

```bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hghann/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"
```

This will clone or download, this repo to `~/.dotfiles` depending on the
availability of `git`, `curl` or `wget`.

2. Alternatively, clone manually into the desired location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hghann/voidrice.git ~/.dots
```

Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to install everything
[listed above](#package-overview), and [config](./.config) (using
[make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)):

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
make init
```

The installation process in the Makefile is tested on every push and every week
in this [GitHub Action](https://github.com/hghann/voidrice/actions).
